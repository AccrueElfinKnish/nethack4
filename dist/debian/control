Description: dungeon crawl game
 NetHack 4 is a modernized version of the classic roguelike game NetHack. It
 adds a completely new user interface, a network mode for playing on public
 servers and much more. It also tries to avoid killing the player with the
 interface - we feel that player deaths should be the result of their actions,
 not their typos.
 .
 NetHack 4 is a single player dungeon exploration game.
 Unlike many other Dungeons & Dragons-inspired games, the
 emphasis in NetHack4 is on discovering the detail of the dungeon and not simply
 killing everything in sight - in fact, killing everything in sight is a good
 way to die quickly. Each game presents a different landscape - the random
 number generator provides an essentially unlimited number of variations of the
 dungeon and its denizens to be discovered by the player in one of a number of
 characters: you can pick your race, your role, and your gender.
